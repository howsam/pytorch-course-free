# PyTorch Free Course

Welcome to the PyTorch Free Course repository! This course is designed to help you learn the basics of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, through a series of weekly lessons. Each week, we will cover a new topic, starting from basic tensor operations to more advanced machine learning models.

This course is produced by [Howsam AI Academy](https://howsamaiacademy.com), and you can find accompanying video lectures [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=YOUR_PLAYLIST_LINK).

## Course Outline

### Week 1: Torch as NumPy
In the first week, we will explore how to use PyTorch tensors as an alternative to NumPy arrays. You'll learn about:
- Creating and manipulating tensors
- Basic tensor operations
- Converting between PyTorch tensors and NumPy arrays

### Week 2: Linear Regression from Scratch
This week focuses on implementing linear regression from scratch using PyTorch tensors. Key concepts include:
- Understanding linear regression
- Implementing the linear regression algorithm
- Training the model without using PyTorch's high-level APIs

### Week 3: Linear Regression with Autograd
Building on our linear regression model, we will now leverage PyTorch's autograd module to automatically compute gradients. Topics covered:
- Introduction to autograd
- Using autograd to simplify gradient computation
- Updating our linear regression model with autograd
